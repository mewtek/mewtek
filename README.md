## Hi, I'm April! I make things.

``She/They/Any``

I'm the primary developer for the [OpenStar](https://github.com/mewtek/OpenStar) project, a project aimed at recreating The Weather Channel's IntelliStar systems using Haxe. I also work alot in Source 2 using s&box.

My primary languages for programming are:
* Python
* C#
* Haxe
* C++

And at the moment I'm learning more and more about langauges like GO, JavaScript, as well as some markdown langauges like HTML and CSS, likely using SCSS.
