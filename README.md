### June

Hi! I'm June P. I make things.

``She/They/Any``

I'm a developer for CoatHanger Studios, a small game/software group I work on with my girlfriend [Maggie](https://github.com/magdelenn).

I'm the primary devloper for the [OpenStar](https://github.com/Zeexel/OpenStar) project, a project aimed at recreating The Weather Channel's IntelliStar systems using Haxe.

My primary languages for programming are:
* Python
* C#
* Haxe

And at the moment I'm learning more and more about langauges like GO, JavaScript, as well as some markdown langauges like HTML and CSS, likely using SCSS.
